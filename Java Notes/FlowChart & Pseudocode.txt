Flowchart:

•A flowchart is a visual diagram that shows the flow of a program or process step by step.
•It uses symbols:
•Oval (⬤) → Start / End
•Rectangle (□) → Process / Calculation
•Diamond (◇) → Decision (Yes/No or True/False)
•Parallelogram (⧫) → Input / Output
•It makes logic easy to understand at a glance.

General Flow Diagram Structure:  

   ⬤ Start
      ↓
  ⧫ Input
      ↓
  □ Process
      ↓
  ◇ Decision
   ↙     ↘
 □ StepA  □ StepB
      ↓
   ⬤ End


1.Example – Salary & Bonus

Problem: If salary of a person is 20,000 → give ₹2000 bonus, else ₹1000.

Flowchart

   ⬤ Start
      ↓
  ◇ Input Salary
      ↓
  ◇ Is Salary = 20000 ?
   ↙              ↘
 □ Bonus = 2000   □ Bonus = 1000
   ↘              ↙
      ↓
  ◇ Print Bonus
      ↓
   ⬤ End


2. Example – Check Prime Number

Problem: Check whether a given number is prime or not.

   ⬤ Start
      ↓
  ◇ Input Number
      ↓
  □ Set flag = true
      ↓
  □ Check divisibility from 2 to n-1
      ↓
  ◇ Is number divisible by any i?
   ↙              ↘
 □ flag = false   □ continue
   ↓                  ↓
  ◇ After loop, is flag = true?
   ↙              ↘
 □ Print Prime   □ Print Not Prime
      ↓
   ⬤ End




Pseudocode:

•Pseudocode is a plain English description of program steps, written in a way that looks like code but is not actual programming.
•It is independent of any programming language.
•It helps programmers plan logic before coding.

General Pseudocode Structure:

BEGIN
   INPUT data
   PROCESS the data
   IF condition is true THEN
       Do step A
   ELSE
       Do step B
   ENDIF
   OUTPUT result
END


1.Example – Salary & Bonus
Problem: If salary of a person is 20,000 → give ₹2000 bonus, else ₹1000.

START
  INPUT salary
  IF salary = 20000 THEN
       bonus ← 2000
  ELSE
       bonus ← 1000
  ENDIF
  PRINT bonus
END


2. Example – Check Prime Number
Problem: Check whether a given number is prime or not.

START
  INPUT number
  flag ← true

  FOR i ← 2 TO number-1 DO
       IF number % i = 0 THEN
            flag ← false
            BREAK
       ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  IF flag = true THEN
       PRINT "Prime"
  ELSE
       PRINT "Not Prime"
  ENDIF
END
