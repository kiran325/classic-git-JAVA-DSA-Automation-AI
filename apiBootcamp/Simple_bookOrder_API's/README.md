# apiBootcamp_325
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for two applications to talk to each other
It works like a waiter in a restaurant â€” you (the user) place an order, the waiter (API) takes it to the kitchen (server), and then brings back the food (response).

Learning APIs from scratch means:
Understanding how to send a request (like asking for something).
Reading the response (the answer from the server).
Practicing with basic actions like GET (fetch data), POST (add data), PUT (update), and DELETE (remove) using tools like Postman.
